Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, having generated an estimated US$29 trillion in 2017 
(Source: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes.
Due to the prevalence of these platforms, developers should understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites.

This is an example of me building the back end for an e-commerce site. I worked with an Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with 
a MySQL database.
